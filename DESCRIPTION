Title: Work With 'rmote' Package to Support Viewing Objects from Remote Machines
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Eric C. Anderson
Maintainer: The package maintainer <eric.anderson@noaa.gov>
Description: Provides the rView() function.  When run on a remote machine
    that has been initialized with rmote::start_rmote(), viewing an object
    using rView(obj) will save it to the temp directory being used for other
    rmote objects (figures and help files).  When the same command is run on the
    local machine (with no rmote initialization), it will download the rds file
    saved on the remote server and then View() it.
